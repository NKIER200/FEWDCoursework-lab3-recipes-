# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Changes made since creation of plans

log in system was removed as I felt it was not necessary.

recipes were added to the entry for each food item.

menu, ingredients list and recipes are now on the same page.

The home page features a simple looping video of a pizza base having sauce applied to it. The navigation bar allows for acces to "Menu", About Us" and "Locations" from the "Home" page.

navigate from the home page to 'menu' to view the recipes. click the arrow to open the accordion.

this will allow you to see the category, the bio of the food item, the price of the food item, the recipe, a button, that when pressed calls the nutritional data.

FetchNutrition, defys belief and reason by requesting the API 1.5k (one thousand and five hundred) times in less than ten minutes. There is no loop causing this. could be a mac issue.

underneath the nutritional info, there is a number input and a button in order to submit a review for the recipe. multiple numerical reviews can be made.

Finally, below the review area, there are two buttons. One to add to a menu, and one to add to an ingredients list.

to clear from the ingredients list and menu simply click the home button and navigate back to the menu page.
